Expense Tracker: This was an easy setup that allowed me to build on learnt skills from our React.js module.  
This app uses: 
useState()
props
.map()
I will build upon this by creating links for my application and also a tracker function that can tell the amount spent for the month. 
I also plan on making my data from state global by using Redux.
